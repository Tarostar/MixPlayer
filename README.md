# MixPlayer
Simultaneous playback of dual audio organised in files and folders.

Mix Player - play two separate tracks of mp3, flac, ogg or wav independently and easily by organising them by folder and name.

Also has a few nice additional features like storing images associated with each track and adding text information to be displayed for each track.

Adapts to size of display and if big enough also has sorting and search.
